# Mobile App

> Work in progress.

Cross-platform React Native mobile application using Expo. The purpose of this
app is to turn a phone into a controller. Users need to download the Expo app
([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent),
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)), and then are
prompted to enter a code to join a single/multi-player gaming session. The
app will then load with the corresponding console's controller. Currently
supports NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance.

## Getting Started

Use `yarn` to install packages:
```
yarn
```

Start Expo development server:
```
expo start
```
